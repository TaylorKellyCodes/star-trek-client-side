Welcome to my Star Trek LCAT Species information finder!
Here is the finished product: https://star-trek-species.netlify.app/
Just enter the species name in the text box and click "Get Info" and be amazed.


How I made it:

I used Node.js, Express, and a HTML/CSS Template from https://www.thelcars.com/ to create an app that you can use to look for information on the species in the Star Trek universe! The API code is here-> https://github.com/TaylorKellyCodes/star-trek-api and is currently hosted on Heroku.

Did you find an error or bug? Feel free to reach out to me and I can check it out once I get some time.

Live long and prosper.
