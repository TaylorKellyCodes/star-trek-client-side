# Star Trek Federation Field Guide 

Just enter the species name in the text box and click "Get Info" and you'll get a picture and helpful information about the species.

### How I made it:

## Tech Used: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I added onto a HTML/CSS Template from https://www.thelcars.com/ to create a full-stack app that you can use to look for information on different species in the Star Trek universe! The API is made from scratch with JavaScript and stores all of the information and pictures. This is one of two repos, split from froent end and back end code.

### Optimizations

I would like to set this up with MongoDB and an option to add a species with the relevant information along with a system of checks before it is merged with the main branch so when we inevitable expand the Star Trek universe with more species, the database can be updated by fans of the work.

### Lessons Learned: 

I learned building an API from scratch wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it was. I was blown away by the template I used from https://www.thelcars.com/. I really appreciated how they made it look exactly like the computer systems in the original Star Trek computer systems.
